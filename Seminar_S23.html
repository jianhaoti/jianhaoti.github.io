	In this talk, we'll introduce the concept of a vector bundle and discuss the classic question 
	of which spheres are parllelizable. We will attack this question by showing the only spheres which are Lie groups have dimensions 
	using characteristic classes. 0, 1, 3. If time permits, we will give an indication of which spheres are parallelizable
	by considering real division algebras.

    <td> <b> <span style="color:#FFA500">Rate of decay of probability measures on Cantor sets. </span></b>
	One way to find the “size” of a set is by understanding how quickly the Fourier transform of a probability measure on that set decays. Along these lines we will introduce a general form of a Cantor set, how to construct a probability measure on it, then show what the Fourier transform of that probability measure is. If time permits we will also show how to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of these sets.

    <td> <b> <span style="color:#FFA500">Shake Concordance.</span></b>
	The main gist is that concordance is a relation that knots have. I will first start out by explaining what concordance and slice-ness is and then i will go on to describe shake concordance and how it generalizes the previous notions. I might also bring up the slice ribbon conjecture as an aside.
