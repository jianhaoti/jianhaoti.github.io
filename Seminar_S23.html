	In this talk, we'll introduce the concept of a vector bundle and discuss the classic question 
	of which spheres are parllelizable. We will attack this question by showing the only spheres which are Lie groups have dimensions 
	building a nonzero de Rham cohomology class in H^3. 0, 1, 3. If time permits, we will give an indication of which spheres are parallelizable
	by considering real division algebras.

	One way to find the “size” of a set is by understanding how quickly the Fourier transform of a 
	probability measure on that set decays. Along these lines we will introduce a general form of a Cantor set, 
	how to construct a probability measure on it, then show what the Fourier transform of that probability measure is. 
	If time permits we will also show how to calculate the Hausdorff dimension of these sets.

	The main gist is that concordance is a relation that knots have. I will first start out by explaining what 
	concordance and slice-ness is and then I will go on to describe shake concordance and how it generalizes the 
	previous notions. I might also bring up the slice ribbon conjecture as an aside.

	Over the past 40 years, Ricci flow has been a topic of great interest in geometric analysis. In this discussion 
	we will begin with a brief review of the history of the subject, then explain two types of motivating examples, namely 
	Einstein manifolds and Ricci solitons. Time permitting, we will conclude by stating the curvature evolution equations.

    <td> <b> <span style="color:#FFA500">A basic overview of semigroup theory. </span></b>
	The well-posedness of the heat equation with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on a nice domain 
	Omega in R^n is well known. We explain how well-posedness in this context arises from the more general theory of 
	semigroups, and how they allow us to study a wider class of initial/boundary value problems. In particular we 
	discuss the basics of semigroup theory and will sketch proofs for the famous Hille-Yosida and Lumer-Phillips theorems. 
	These in tandem are used to prove the well-posedness of the heat equation. We hope to use this talk as a building block 
	for future discussions about current research in the study of heat kernels, especially in the context of Riemannian and 
	sub-Riemannian geometry.

	    and Seifert surfaces. It will then briefly touch on Slice-ness, concordance, 
	    and the knot concordance group.

	In this talk we will motivate Lie algebras as the analogue of an 
	inner product space for the endomorphism ring of a vector space. Then we 
	will develop basic Lie theory including the notion of ideals, quotients, adjoint representations, 
	and some natural isomorphism results in this context. With this machinery we will prove the first 
	surprising result which begins the classification story for semisimple Lie algebras: namely that every 
	simple Lie algebra is  isomorphic to a linear Lie algebra.

	for a nonlinear approximation of 3D smectic liquid crystals.</span></b>
	
	Liquid crystal is a state of matter with properties between those of ordinary liquids and solids. In particular, we are 
	concerned with the free energy of smectic-A liquid crystals, which are liquid crystals found at low temperatures in which 
	the nematic director of the liquid crystal layers coincides with the unit normal. We first discuss basic embeddings and 
	compactness results regarding negative-order Sobolev spaces. We then show that we obtain compactness in L^2 for the  
	gradient u_n of an energy-bounded sequence u_n in H^2 satisfying some additional technical assumptions. If time permits, 
	we consider a sharp lower bound on the free energies.
